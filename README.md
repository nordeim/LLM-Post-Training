# AI Large Language Model (LLM) Training Workflow: From Pretrained Base to Advanced Post-Training with Qwen3 and DeepSeek R1

## Abstract

This research paper presents a comprehensive workflow for training large language models (LLMs) starting from an open-source pretrained base model, exemplified by Alibaba Cloud’s Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base. It details the critical post-training steps including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for instruction following and advanced reinforcement learning (RL) techniques that enhance reasoning and generalization. The paper explores state-of-the-art RL methodologies inspired by DeepSeek R1 and Qwen3’s multi-stage RL pipeline, providing practical examples and sample code for each phase. This guide aims to serve researchers and practitioners seeking to build, fine-tune, and optimize open-weight LLMs with modern, efficient, and scalable methods.

## 1. Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing by enabling machines to generate coherent, context-aware text across diverse domains. Open-source LLMs like Qwen and its variants have democratized access to powerful models with billions of parameters. However, training such models from scratch is prohibitively expensive, so practitioners often start from pretrained base models with open weights. Post-training steps such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) are essential to adapt these models for instruction-following and reasoning-intensive tasks.

This paper focuses on the **post-training workflow** starting from a pretrained open-weight model like **Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base** available on Hugging Face. We detail the SFT process to align the model to human instructions and explore the cutting-edge RL techniques exemplified by DeepSeek R1 and Qwen3, which emphasize reasoning, self-reflection, and efficient inference.

## 2. Starting from a Pretrained Base Model: Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base

### 2.1 Overview of Qwen Models

Qwen is a family of large language models developed by Alibaba Cloud, spanning sizes from 4B to 235B parameters. The Qwen3 series introduces advanced post-training pipelines emphasizing reasoning and response speed balance. The **Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base** model is a 30 billion parameter mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with 3 billion active parameters per inference step, designed for efficiency without sacrificing reasoning ability [1][2].

### 2.2 Obtaining and Preparing the Base Model

The base model weights are publicly available on Hugging Face, enabling researchers to start from a strong pretrained checkpoint. Preparing the base model involves:

- Downloading the model and tokenizer artifacts.
- Setting up the training environment with compatible frameworks (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, DeepSpeed, Accelerate).
- Verifying hardware compatibility for MoE architectures.

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

## 3. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for Instruction Following

### 3.1 Purpose of SFT

SFT adapts the base model to follow human instructions by training on curated datasets of input-output pairs. This step improves the model’s alignment with user expectations and safety requirements.

### 3.2 Dataset Preparation

Instruction tuning datasets typically contain:

- Prompt: A user instruction or question.
- Response: The desired model output.

Examples include open datasets like Alpaca, ShareGPT, or custom-curated instruction-response pairs.

### 3.3 Training Procedure

SFT is generally performed with supervised learning using cross-entropy loss on the response tokens, conditioning on the prompt.

Key hyperparameters:

- Learning rate: Typically low (e.g., 1e-5 to 5e-5).
- Batch size: Depends on hardware capacity.
- Epochs: 1-3 usually suffice.
- Optimizer: AdamW with weight decay.

### 3.4 Example Code Snippet for SFT

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments, DataCollatorForSeq2Seq

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./sft-qwen3-30b",
    per_device_train_batch_size=1,
    gradient_accumulation_steps=16,
    learning_rate=3e-5,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    fp16=True,
    save_steps=500,
    save_total_limit=3,
    logging_dir="./logs",
)

data_collator = DataCollatorForSeq2Seq(tokenizer, model=model)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,  # preprocessed instruction dataset
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    data_collator=data_collator,
)

trainer.train()
```

### 3.5 Practical Considerations

- Use mixed precision training (fp16) for efficiency.
- Monitor loss and validation metrics.
- Use prompt engineering to format inputs consistently.

## 4. Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Reasoning and Behavior Improvement

### 4.1 Motivation for RL

While SFT aligns the model to instructions, RL further refines behavior by optimizing for long-term objectives, such as reasoning accuracy, coherence, and safety. RL enables the model to self-improve through reward feedback rather than static supervised labels.

### 4.2 DeepSeek R1: RL-First Approach

DeepSeek R1 emphasizes reasoning by:

- Starting with a small supervised cold start dataset.
- Using **rule-based reward models** to provide scalable feedback on intermediate reasoning steps.
- Employing **multi-stage RL optimization** to improve logical consistency and self-verification.
- Utilizing architectural innovations like multi-head latent attention and load balancing for efficiency [4].

#### 4.2.1 Cold Start Strategy

A small curated dataset helps bootstrap reasoning capabilities before full RL training.

#### 4.2.2 Reward-Based Training

Automated reward models score intermediate steps and final answers, enabling structured reinforcement signals.

#### 4.2.3 Multi-Stage RL Pipeline

- Stage 1: Basic problem-solving accuracy.
- Stage 2: Self-correction and logical consistency.
- Stage 3: Advanced multi-step reasoning and self-verification.

### 4.3 Qwen3 Post-Training RL Pipeline

Qwen3 uses a **four-stage post-training pipeline** [2][3]:

| Stage                    | Description                                         |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Long Chain-of-Thought Cold Start | Model learns step-by-step reasoning on complex tasks. |
| 2. Reasoning Reinforcement Learning | RL to improve problem-solving strategies.          |
| 3. Thinking Mode Fusion            | Balances slow, careful reasoning with faster responses. |
| 4. General RL                     | Improves general instruction following and agentic behaviors. |

For smaller models like Qwen3-30B-A3B, knowledge distillation from larger models is used to retain reasoning ability efficiently.

### 4.4 Practical Implementation of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)

A common RL approach is **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**, which optimizes a reward model that scores model outputs.

#### 4.4.1 Sample RLHF Code Outline with Hugging Face and TRL

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from trl import PPOTrainer, PPOConfig

model_name = "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Load or define a reward model that scores outputs
reward_model = ...  # e.g., a classifier or rule-based evaluator

ppo_config = PPOConfig(
    model_name=model_name,
    learning_rate=1.41e-5,
    batch_size=16,
    ppo_epochs=4,
)

ppo_trainer = PPOTrainer(model, tokenizer, reward_model, config=ppo_config)

for batch in dataloader:
    query_tensors = tokenizer(batch["prompt"], return_tensors="pt", padding=True).input_ids
    response_tensors = ppo_trainer.generate(query_tensors)
    rewards = reward_model(response_tensors)
    ppo_trainer.step(query_tensors, response_tensors, rewards)
```

### 4.5 Challenges and Best Practices

- Designing effective reward models is critical.
- Balancing exploration and exploitation during RL.
- Efficiently handling large batch sizes and distributed training.
- Monitoring for reward hacking and unintended behaviors.

## 5. Evaluation and Benchmarking

### 5.1 Metrics

- **Instruction Following Accuracy:** Comparing model outputs to human references.
- **Reasoning Benchmarks:** Tasks like math problems, code generation, and logic puzzles.
- **Human Evaluation:** For coherence, helpfulness, and safety.

### 5.2 Benchmark Datasets

- MMLU, GSM8K for reasoning.
- HumanEval for code.
- Custom instruction datasets.

### 5.3 Automated Evaluation Tools

- Perplexity.
- BLEU, ROUGE for text similarity.
- Reward model scores.

## 6. Deployment and Inference Optimization

### 6.1 Model Compression and Distillation

Qwen3 lightweight models are distilled from larger models to reduce inference cost while retaining reasoning ability [2].

### 6.2 Quantization

Techniques like 4-bit or 6-bit quantization reduce memory footprint.

### 6.3 Efficient Serving

- Use MoE sparsity for activating only parts of the model.
- Load balancing strategies as in DeepSeek R1.

## 7. Conclusion and Future Directions

Training open-weight LLMs like Qwen3-30B-A3B-Base involves a multi-phase workflow starting from a pretrained base, followed by supervised fine-tuning and advanced reinforcement learning. The state-of-the-art RL methods exemplified by DeepSeek R1 and Qwen3’s multi-stage pipelines enable models to achieve superior reasoning and instruction-following capabilities. Practical implementation requires careful dataset preparation, reward modeling, and training infrastructure.

Future work includes improving RL reward models, enhancing multi-modal capabilities, and increasing transparency in training disclosures. The open-source ecosystem, including Hugging Face and Alibaba Cloud’s Qwen, provides a fertile ground for continued innovation in LLM training and deployment.
